<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]]

The purpose of this project was the investigate the viability of VR technology as an educational device for industry skills. More specifically, to teach skills that require some kind of environmental interaction that would be expensive to mock. I would do this by setting up an experiment where subjects would learn using a VR application I develop.
